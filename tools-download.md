# mongo binary (mongo.exe on Windows)

The mongo application/shell has been deprecated and a slightly better version called `mongosh` replaces it.
`mongosh` is largely the same other than the command to run it now is `mongosh` rather than `mongo` of course.

You can download `mongosh` as part of the [**MongoDB Shell**](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell) 
download from their website.

# Robomongo

Robomongo was acquired by Studio3T. It's official name was changed to Robo3T and just recently the download
location was removed from the website. But you can still download the exact same file from the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/Studio3T/robomongo/releases

(Open source for the win). Find your platform's version there and download it.
